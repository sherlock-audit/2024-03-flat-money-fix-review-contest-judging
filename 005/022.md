# Manipulation and Exploitation of `StableModule` Contract to Manipulate Withdrawal Fees andPpotentially Profit from Exploiting User Funds.

## Summary
The exploitation of `StableModule` in the `StableWithdrawFee` can lead to an attacker manipulating withdrawal fees, resulting in unauthorized fund withdrawals or significant financial losses for users of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.  Insufficient Access Control: Functions like `setStableWithdrawFee` are only protected by `onlyOwner`, which might not be enough if the contract owner is compromised or if a bug in another part of the contract allows access.

2. Fee Manipulation: The `setStableWithdrawFee` function allows the owner to set the fee to any value up to 1% (0.01e18). If the owner is compromised or misuses this function, they could set the fee too high and manipulate user withdrawals.

3. Lack of Validation: The contract lacks specific validations on `_executableAtTime`, `_announcedDeposit`, and `_announcedWithdraw` parameters. This can lead to unintended behaviors if these parameters are manipulated.

## Impact
1. Financial Loss: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to manipulate withdrawal fees and siphon funds from users' accounts, leading to potential financial loss for users.

2. Reduced Trust: Users of the contract may lose trust in the platform due to the potential for exploitation, resulting in reduced participation and usage of the contract.

3. Market Manipulation: By manipulating withdrawal fees, an attacker could disrupt the market dynamics and affect the stability of the protocol, potentially causing broader financial instability within the ecosystem.

## Proof of Concept 
1. Deploy the Attack contract and pass the address of the `StableModule` contract as a constructor argument.

2. Call the `manipulateWithdrawalFee` function with a high fee value (e.g., 0.01e18) to manipulate withdrawal fees.

3. Use the `exploitWithdraw` function to withdraw funds from an account. The attacker can set the parameters such as account, `executableAtTime`, and `announcedWithdraw` according to their exploitation strategy.

    }

    // Attack function to manipulate withdrawal fees
    function manipulateWithdrawalFee(uint256 newFee) external {
        // Assuming the attacker somehow gains access to the owner role
        stableModule.setStableWithdrawFee(newFee);
    }

    // Attack function to withdraw funds
    function exploitWithdraw(
        address account,
        uint64 executableAtTime,
        FlatcoinStructs.AnnouncedStableWithdraw calldata announcedWithdraw
    ) external {
        // Assuming the attacker gains permission to executeWithdraw
        (uint256 amountOut, uint256 withdrawFee) = stableModule.executeWithdraw(
            account,
            executableAtTime,
            announcedWithdraw
        );

        // The attacker can now profit from the withdrawal fee
        // For example, redirecting the withdrawn amount to their own account
    }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Stronger Access Control: Ensure that only authorized entities can access sensitive functions.

2. Limit Fee Adjustments: Consider implementing tighter restrictions on fee adjustments, or remove the ability to change fees altogether once set.

3. Parameter Validation: Add proper validation checks on parameters such as `_executableAtTime`, `_announcedDeposit`, and `_announcedWithdraw` to avoid unexpected behavior.
