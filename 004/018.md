# The issue titled "Oracle can return different prices in same transaction" is not remediated.

## Summary

The issue titled "Oracle can return different prices in same transaction" ([Issue 216](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney-judging/issues/216)) has not been remediated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue titled "Oracle can return different prices in same transaction" ([Issue 216](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-flatmoney-judging/issues/216)) has not been remediated. In the current implementation, it is still possible to submit and read two different prices in the same transaction to carry out the attack described in the report.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To remediate the issue, one or more of the following possible solutions could be adopted to reduce the risk:

1) The attack mentioned in the original report requires executing an order with the first price and another order with the second price, ideally all within the same block. Otherwise, the chance of a profitable attack will be low. Consider allowing each account to execute only one order within a single block.
2) If the price has been updated at the start of a block, store this price and use this price consistently throughout all orders executed within the same block. If there is a subsequent price update within the same block, they will be ignored. The protocol must ensure that the "freshness" of the price is acceptable.

One might think that the current locking mechanism is similar to the above-mentioned first solution. However, if we look at the original report, one possible attack path is to use one leveraged order + one limit order. The issue is that the current locking mechanism only ensures that an account cannot have more than one announced leveraged order. Thus, an account is allowed to have one leveraged order + one limit order required to carry out the attacks mentioned in the report. The correct approach is to ensure that an account can only be one announced order, regardless of whether it is a leveraged or limit order at any point in time.
