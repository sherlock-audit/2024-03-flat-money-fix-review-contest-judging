# The `newAverageEntryPrice` for `averagePrice` is calculating incorrectly.

## Summary
See details.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `updateGlobalPositionData` updates the global position data for all users . However we know that the `averagePrice` is the price for opening new position for user. But when we updating the new `averagePrice` for all users it is very less than it should be because everytime when the  `sizeOpenedTotal` is increasing then the `newAverageEntryPrice` is decreasing or when the `_additionalSizeDelta` is changing. So the problem is here that after some point when there will be much `sizeOpenedTotal` then this `newAverageEntryPrice` will be zero or very less then initialial `averagePrice`  . Let's analyze how ?

1) Lets say initially `averagePrice` = 1000.
2) The `sizeOpenedTotal`  = 10 , and the price of underlying asset is 100.
3) Now if we want to update `newAverageEntryPrice` for 2 more opened position (`_additionalSizeDelta`) with (5 + 5 eth) = 10 , then it will be halft of previous `averagePrice` which was 1000 let see how.

```javascript
int256 averageEntryPrice = int256(_globalPositions.averagePrice);
```

```javascript
int256 newAverageEntryPrice = ((averageEntryPrice * sizeOpenedTotal) +
                (int256(_price) * _additionalSizeDelta)) / (sizeOpenedTotal + _additionalSizeDelta);
```

4) `newAverageEntryPrice` will be = ((1000* 10) + (100 + 10))/(10 + 10) = 505.5 ,which is half of previous `averageEntryPrice`.

```javascript
 _globalPositions = FlatcoinStructs.GlobalPositions({
                marginDepositedTotal: newMarginDepositedTotal,
                sizeOpenedTotal: (int256(_globalPositions.sizeOpenedTotal) + _additionalSizeDelta).toUint256(),
                averagePrice: uint256(newAverageEntryPrice)
            });
```
5) So now we can say that  `averagePrice` will be decreasing for  all users everytime when the `_additionalSizeDelta` changes or if the `sizeOpenedTotal` is increasing. 
 
## Impact
`averagePrice` can be zero or very less for users if there will be much `sizeOpenedTotal` .

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Please make sure that the `averagePrice` should be little bit higher for all users everytime when the  `sizeOpenedTotal` is increasing rather than decreasing.
