# Users could get the `liquidatorFee` by calling `liquidate` function themselves.

## Summary
See details.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `liquidate` function is responsible for liquidating the position of user . However , there is no check for liquidator to be unique.
So now users are able to collect `liquidatorFee` by liquidating themselves.

## Impact
Eventually users will be in profit after liquidation
