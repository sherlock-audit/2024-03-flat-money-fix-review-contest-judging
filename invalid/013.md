# Vault inflation attack is still be possible

## Summary
See details.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `stableCollateralPerShare` function calculates the collateral per share for user . However , if the first user / first depositer calculates it he will be able to get 1 share by providing 10,000 wei . So next time when the another user calculates it the first depositor can inflate the `_collateralPerShare` for him . Lets analize what could be happen .

1) Lets say initially when `totalSupply` = 0.
2) User1 deposits 1 wei as _maxAge  and gets 1e18 share = 1 share.
3) User2 ( innocent victim) enters and deposits 1 ether but user1 which is melicious front-runs user2.
4) After front-running user2 , user1 gets  = 1 / 1 = 1 share.
5) Now `totalSuppy` = 2.
6) So user 2 will be getting due to rounding down = 1 / 2 = 0.
7) Finally user1 claims all his shares by `executeWithdraw` function .



## Impact
First depositor is able to steal innocent victims share.
